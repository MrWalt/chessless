# Chessless

A fully vanilla (Just Javascript, CSS and HTML), no-library, no-AI, no-copy-pasting from google chess game I am working on in my freetime.

## Goals
My current goals for this project are

* [ ] Create chess and its logic from scratch
* [ ] Add Player VS. Machine via a chess engine made from scratch
* [ ] Add Easy, Medium and Hard difficulties

## Setup
To set this project up on your local machine you run ```git clone https://github.com/MrWalt/chessless``` in your terminal.
Then you just run it with Live Preview
